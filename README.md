# The Good News of Jesus Christ — One Page Website

This project is a simple one-page website that presents the gospel of Jesus Christ clearly and directly, with supporting Bible verses.  
It is designed to be **print-friendly**, **mobile-responsive**, and easy to **translate into any language**.

## ✨ Features
- Full text of the gospel message, structured in seven sections:
  1. The Problem  
  2. Condemnation Without Christ  
  3. God Shows No Partiality  
  4. God’s Love and Provision  
  5. The Free Gift of Salvation  
  6. The Urgent Call  
  7. The Promise of Life in Christ  
- Uses [Bootstrap 5.3.3](https://getbootstrap.com/) for clean, responsive styling.  
- Includes a **print button** for quick handouts or PDF export.  
- Footer space for a **website link or QR code**, so readers can take next steps.  
- Lightweight: only one `.html` file, no external dependencies beyond Bootstrap.

## 📖 How to Use
1. Open the `gospel-one-page.html` file in any web browser.  
2. Customize the **footer link** (`YourWebsiteHere.org`) with your own ministry, church, or resource website.  
3. Replace the **QR Code placeholder** with your own generated QR code (PNG or SVG).  
4. To distribute:
   - Share the file directly.
   - Upload it to any web server or static hosting service (e.g., GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, Netlify).
   - Print it as a handout or save it as a PDF.

## 🌍 Translation
This page was intentionally written with **clean HTML structure** for easy translation.  
- Replace text directly in the HTML file.  
- Keep verse references intact, even when translating Bible text.  
- You may add a language switcher or duplicate the file for multiple languages.
