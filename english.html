    <p class="verse">“All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” (Romans 3:23)</p>
    <p class="verse">“The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Romans 6:23)</p>

  <section id="condemnation" class="card-lite">
    <h2>2) Condemnation Without Christ</h2>
    <p class="verse">“He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.” (John 3:18)</p>
    <p class="verse">“It is appointed for men to die once, but after this the judgment.” (Hebrews 9:27)</p>
    <p>Without Christ, we stand guilty before a holy God, facing judgment.</p>

    <p class="verse">“Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures.” (1 Corinthians 15:3–4)</p>
